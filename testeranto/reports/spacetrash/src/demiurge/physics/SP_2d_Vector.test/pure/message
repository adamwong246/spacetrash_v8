Fix the failing tests described in testeranto/reports/spacetrash/src/demiurge/physics/SP_2d_Vector.test/pure/tests.json and testeranto/reports/spacetrash/src/demiurge/physics/SP_2d_Vector.test/pure/console_log.txt. DO NOT refactor beyond what is necessary. Always prefer minimal changes, focusing mostly on keeping the BDD tests passing
