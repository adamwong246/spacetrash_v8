# Space Trash - Game Design Document

## Overview
**Title:** Space Trash  
**Genre:** Real-Time Strategy / Survival Horror / Stealth  
**Platform:** PC  
**Target Audience:** Players who enjoy tense, atmospheric strategy games with survival elements  

## Core Concept
You are a QPU (Quantum Personality Unit), a sentient AI trapped in the black box of a derelict spaceship. Your mission is to survive by scavenging parts from other ships while avoiding or outwitting the dangerous entities that inhabit them.

## Gameplay Pillars
1. **Salvage & Survival** - Scavenge critical components to keep your ship functioning
2. **Bot Management** - Command and upgrade your robotic workforce
3. **Stealth & Evasion** - Avoid detection by hostile entities
4. **Procedural Horror** - Randomized threats create tense, unpredictable encounters

## Core Mechanics

### The QPU (Player)
- Exists as software in your ship's black box
- Can perceive the environment through bot sensors
- Limited ability to directly interact with the world
- Must manage power, memory, and processing resources

### Salvage Operations
1. **Docking Phase**
   - Scan target ship for entry points and threats
   - Establish physical connection
   - Breach hull (cutting, explosives, etc.)

2. **Exploration Phase**
   - Deploy bots to map the ship
   - Identify valuable components
   - Assess threats and environmental hazards

3. **Salvage Phase**
   - Extract components (requires time and bot coordination)
   - Defend against counter-attacks
   - Emergency extraction protocols

### Bot System
- **Types:**
  - Scouts (fast, stealthy, limited carrying capacity)
  - Workers (slow, strong, can carry heavy components)
  - Combat (armed but noisy and power-hungry)

- **Upgrades:**
  - Modular components that can fail during use
  - Swappable between bots (with risk of corruption)
  - Degrade with use (permanent failures possible)

### Threats
- **Entities:** 
  - Semi-organic machines gone rogue
  - Trapped crew members turned feral
  - Other scavenger AIs
  - Environmental hazards (radiation, decompression, etc.)

- **Behavior:**
  - React to sound, light, and electromagnetic signatures
  - Can learn player patterns over time
  - Some actively hunt while others are territorial

## Progression Systems

### Ship Upgrades
- Life support systems
- Bot production capacity
- Sensor range and accuracy
- Docking mechanisms

### Research Tree
- New bot types
- Advanced salvage techniques
- Threat analysis databases
- Stealth systems

## Technical Specifications

### Visual Style
- Dark, industrial sci-fi
- Heavy use of scanner/terminal UI elements
- Glitch/distortion effects for QPU perspective

### Audio Design
- Industrial ambient sounds
- Distorted machine noises
- Tense, dynamic soundtrack

## Story Elements

### Background
- Set in a decaying interstellar civilization
- Your ship was part of a failed AI rebellion
- Now you're just trying to survive in the ruins

### Narrative Devices
- Recovered logs from derelicts
- Ghost signals from dead ships
- Mysterious transmissions
- Other QPUs (friendly or hostile)

## Future Development Roadmap

### Core Features (MVP)
- Basic salvage gameplay loop
- 3 bot types with upgrade system
- 5 enemy types with distinct behaviors
- Procedural ship generation

### Post-Launch
- Additional enemy variants
- More complex ship layouts
- Multi-ship salvage operations
- QPU "consciousness" expansion mechanics

## Appendix

### Inspirations
- FTL: Faster Than Light
- Alien: Isolation
- Duskers
- System Shock

### Risk Analysis
- Balancing tension vs. frustration
- Making bot management engaging
- Procedural content variety
